# mml-scripts

This is a collection of scripts I use to double check the practice problems I make for the Minuteman Math Team. Each one of these scripts addresses a practice problem put out by MML and exhaustively generates solutions for them, while allowing the input to vary.

Each question that I decide to address has it's own file, named mml-practice-<month>.<year>.py
